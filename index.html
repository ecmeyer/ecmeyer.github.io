    <p> <strong> Sergei Rachmaninov </strong> </p>

    <p> Rachmaninov's music has colorful chord progressions and intricate counterpoint melodies,<br/>
      with an underlying driving force that is sometimes sinister. </p>

    <p> My favorite Rachmaninov interpreter is <strong>Alexis Weissenberg.</strong><br/>
     His use of the sustain pedal is sparse,
     allowing the notes to ring out clearly.<br/>
     This is especially important for Rachmaninov's music, as it allows
     the complex <br/> counterpoint melodies to be heard 
     rather than simply treated as background harmony. </p>

    <img src="./Resources/FChopinPhoto.jpg" alt="Frederic Chopin" height=250>
    <p> Chopin's music lacks the underlying driving force of Rachmaninov's music,<br/> but instead is more impulsive, with 
     frequent rubato giving a feeling of freedom. </p>
    <p> <strong>Chopin Nocturne in B Major</strong> </p>
    <img src="./Resources/ChopinNoctBMaj.gif" alt="Chopin Nocturne" height=250>
    <p> A while back, I came up with a story to go along with Chopin's Fantasy Impromptu.<br/>
    A village is under attack by horsemen. The villagers drive off the horsemen, and then <br/> mourn their dead and forge armor
    and weapons. When the horsemen come back, <br/>they destroy the village and burn it to the ground. </p>

    <p> I like Beethoven, particularly his later works, because they are like very deliberately crafted stories. </p>

    <p> I first heard the Beethoven Hammerklavier performed when I was at a piano camp in New York,<br/> and 
    it has been one of my favorite Beethoven pieces ever since then. </p>

  <div class="Mozart">
    <hr/>
    <p> Mozart had a very good sense of balance in music. <br/>
    There is active and passive, loud and soft, fast and slow, balanced perfectly. </p>
    <img src="./Resources/WMozart.jpg" alt="Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart" height=250>
    <p> One of my favorite Mozart piano works is the first movement of one of his B Flat Major Sonatas.<br/>
    I think that it really illustrates the perfect balace in Mozart's writing. </p>
